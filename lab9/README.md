## Strategy Pattern

In strategy pattern, there are one interface and classes for each strategy, I have created four strategies in this example, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.The classes for each strategy implements interface Calculator.

## Strategy Pattern using Lambda Expression

In lambda expression or function style programming, I needed to create one interface and jUst one class that defines all strategies in it, so code is wrapped inside only one class and no need to create classes for every strategy. If we need more strategies ahead, then we can just add one more lambda expression, and not seperate classes.

Strategy is suitable to lambda expression, hence, improving the code structure and making the code clean and concise
