I am using Chain of Responsibility Pattern and Observer Pattern.

The flow of the application is: The customer registers to waitlist queue in the Restautant Class. The restaurant adds a customer in a waitlist queue and notifies customer about it. As soon as any of the table is available, Table class add it to available table list and notify the observer, Restaurant Manager. Restaurant manager class notifies Restaurant class. Restaurant class picks up a customer with appropriate party size and sends notfication to that customer. The customer can choose confirm or leave option and sends it to Restaurant manager. If customer confirms it, Restaurant manager class assigns available table to that customer and updates the state of available table. If the customer chooses leave option, then same process is repeated again.

Here, the Restaurant class and RestaurantManager have chain of responsibility pattern. RestaurantManager is the client and the Restaurant class has concrete handlers in the form of customer class’s objects. The RestaurantManager and Table have Observer Pattern. When the state of Table changes to occupied or available it will notify the RestaurantManager class. The Table class is the subject, RestaurantManager is the Observer.
